# Spotify Music Player

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
This is a music player that lets you search for any song based on album, title, or artist and then play that song.
It uses react and bootstrap to make a dynamic webpage and the Spotify API to get the song information and the uri needed to play the song. 

## Executing the program

In the project directory, you can run:

`npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.

## Dependencies

To run the program you will need an access key from Spotify. To obtain this key, you must make an Spotify account and go to the developer section. 
There you can get a client ID and client secret. 
This has not been provided for security reasons. 
In the Dashboard.js file at the top of the file, you will find an INSERT HERE statement. Replace that statement with the client ID and client secret that you receive respectively.
